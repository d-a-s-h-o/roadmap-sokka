            <p class="desc">This is a SSH git server that will be used to store all of our code. We plan to add our
                stable releases to this server and make it available to the public.</p>
            <p class="date">Released</p>
        </div>

            <h1 class="title">The Website</h1>

                users to buy and sell goods and services right from their terminal. It's safer than using a web browser, and a whole lot faster. We're also working on a way to allow users to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrency like Monero and Zcash.</p>

            <p class="desc">We're working on a new operating system that will be open source and free to use. It will be based on Linux, and will be designed to be easy to use, secure, and fast. It will also be packed with a ton of features, and will be available for a wide variety of devices. It will be especially useful for those who want to host various services on their own hardware, such as a web server, a mail server, a VPN, a file host, and more. Alongside the operating system, we're also working on a new package manager for DashOS that will make installing and updating these services (or applets) a breeze.</p>
