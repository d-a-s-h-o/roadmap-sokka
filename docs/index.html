                <h1 class="title">The Code Depot</h1>
                <p class="desc">This is a SSH git server that will be used to store all of my code. I plan to add my
                    stable releases to this server and make it available to the public.</p>

                <h1 class="title">The Website</h1>
                <p class="desc">I'm revamping my website to make it more user friendly and easier to navigate. I'm
                    also
                    adding a blog to the website so that I can keep users up to date on the latest news.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Verification Made Easy</h1>
                <p class="desc">With a steady increase in the number of people pretending to be me, I'm working on a
                    way to verify that you're talking to the real Dasho, such as the <a
                        href="https://verify.dasho.dev">verify.dasho.dev</a> utility.</p>

                <h1 class="title">uoIPv7</h1>
                <p class="desc">I'm redefining the way people
                    connect to the internet, by creating a supernet, which will support both anonymous and public connections. It aims to bridge Tor (through proxy like methods and supernetting overlays) with compatibility for NATs and the IPv4 protocol.</p>
                <p class="date">Planned for release in December 2023</p>

                <h1 class="title">Dashed Droplets v5</h1>
                <p class="desc">Okay okay okay, I know that I've been promising this for a while now, but I'm
                    finally working on a new version of Dashed Droplets. It will be faster, more secure, and easier to
                    use than ever before. It will also be open source and free to use, and packed with a ton of new
                    features. Seriously, this release is going to be awesome, and built upon my easy to use but extremely powerful uoIPv7 protocol (see above).</p>
                <p class="date">Planned for release in January 2024</p>

                <h1 class="title">The Documentation</h1>
                <p class="desc">I'm working on a new documentation website that will be used to document all of my
                    projects. It will be easier to use, and will be more organized than my current documentation.</p>
                <p class="date">Planned for release in March 2024</p>

                <h1 class="title">A News Platform</h1>
                <p class="desc">Imagine a news platform that's open source, free to use, and accessible via SSH. Well,
                    I'm working on it. A quick and easy way to stay up to date on the latest news, from a source you
                    can trust, built on technology you can trust.</p>
                <p class="date">Planned for release in April 2024</p>

                <h1 class="title">A SSH Marketplace</h1>
                <p class="desc">Yes, you read that right. I'm working on a marketplace accessible via SSH that will
                    allow
                    users to buy and sell goods and services right from their terminal. It's safer than using a web
                    browser, and a whole lot faster. I'm also working on a way to allow users to pay for goods and
                    services using cryptocurrency like Monero and Zcash.</p>

                <h1 class="title">A New Forum</h1>
                <p class="desc">I'm working on an all new forum that will make sharing information easier than ever.
                    Open source and free to use, it will be a great tool for anyone hoping to set up a community. Like
                    honestly though, who doesn't love a good forum?</p>

                <h1 class="title">Open Source Everything</h1>
                <p class="desc">So you want to set up a chat room huh? A website, a forum, a blog, a marketplace, a VPN,
                    a mail server, your own version of netflix, a couple of darkweb sites, and even a file host? Yep,
                    uploading the source code for you now ...</p>

                <h1 class="title">DashOS</h1>
                <p class="desc">I'm working on a new operating system that will be open source and free to use. It
                    will be based on Debian Linux, and will be designed to be easy to use, secure, and fast. It will also be
                    packed with a ton of features, and will be available for a wide variety of devices. It will be
                    especially useful for those who want to host various services on their own hardware, such as a web
                    server, a mail server, a VPN, a file host, and more. Alongside the operating system, I'm also
                    working on a new package manager for DashOS that will make installing and updating these services
                    (or applets) a breeze. Tor support? Naturally, with amnesic modes available, and per-directory encryption available.</p>
